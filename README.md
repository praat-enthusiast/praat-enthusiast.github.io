 <img style="float: right;" src="/docs/assets/photo_of_me.jpeg" alt="Photo of Joe Pearce" width="225" margin = "75"> Hi! I'm Joe Pearce and I'm a Research Associate at the University of York (Generations of London English) and the University of Glasgow (My Voice, My Glasgow). My PhD research looked at gender and age variation in voice quality in Scottish accents, combining a larger corpus-based study with an in-depth qualitative investigation of a trans woman's experience with her voice. On Generations of London English, I'm managing transcription and forced alignment of data using automated methods, supported by a hard-working team of Research Assistant interns. Contact me if you're interested in our workflow! [https://praat-enthusiast.github.io/] My wider research interests span corpus phonetics, trans linguistics, and incorporating qualitative methods into sociophonetic research. 

This website can direct you towards Praat scripts I've written, and serves as the home of my WhisperX tutorial for linguists.
